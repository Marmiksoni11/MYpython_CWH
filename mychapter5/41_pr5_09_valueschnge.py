# pr 09 can u change values inside a list contained in given set?

a = {8,7,12,"harry",[1,2]}
print(a)

' NO !'

'as a list cant be stored in a set' 

'hashable = unchangable, list is unhashable/changable'

'you can add tuple but you cant change it as tuple is hashable/unchangable'

a = {8,7,12,"harry",(1,2)}
