# the question says "using function" but harry didnt use it at all 
# so i did it this way also i dont see any need to use funtion 
#as for loop does it in two lines



#my way
for i in range(3,0,-1):#loop runs four times from 3 to 1
    print("*" * i)

#harrys way
n = 3
for i in range(n):
     print("*"*(n-i))
