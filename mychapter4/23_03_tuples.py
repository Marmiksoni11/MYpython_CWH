# TUPLES can be created through ()
# tuples cannot be changed / cant assign values to tuples / its immutable

# t = (30,45,78,99,10)
# print(type(t))
# print(t)

# a tuple cant be with only a single element or it becomes int
# so tuple has to be atleast (1,) with one coma 
# () is an empty tuple
a =(1,2)
print(type(a))
print(a)
b = ()#this is an empty tuple
print(type(b))
